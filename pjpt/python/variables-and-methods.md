quote = "this is a string variable"

age = 30 #integer&#x20;

gpa = 3.7 #float - has a decimal

print(quote)

print(quote.title()) #title case

print(len(quote)) #counts characters



print(int(age)) = 30

print(int(30.1)) = 30

print(int(30.9)) = 30 #will not round

print("This is my quote " + quote + " and my age is " + str(age) " - integers need to be converted to a string.

age += 1

print(age) - now should be 31
